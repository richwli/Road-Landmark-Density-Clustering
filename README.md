# Road-Landmark-Density-Clustering
An analysis on evaluating significant roads within an urban network using density based clustering methods. 

Abstract:
Landmarks are the critical portions of roads that are most frequently traversed within the city. The aim of this project is to utilize density based clustering as landmark detection algorithms based on taxi trajectories within the city of Porto, Portugal. For our analysis, we compared the results of our own DBSCAN clustering models with the traditionally used naive count model for landmark evaluation. Using empirical methods and index based clustering evaluation methods, we derived optimal hyperparameters to distinguish significant, dense point clusters in our dataset from surrounding noise. Using these hyperparameters, our DBSCAN model provided a far better evaluation of inner-city road landmarks in comparison to the naive model. This landmark detection algorithm revealed critical road segments within our chosen dataset in Porto, and can be potentially applied in urban analysis for improved urban planning, advertising placement, and traffic prediction in other cities as well.
